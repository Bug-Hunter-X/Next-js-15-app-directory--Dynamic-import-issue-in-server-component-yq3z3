# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic import issue in server component

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior with dynamic imports in server components within the Next.js 15 App Router.  The issue occurs when attempting to dynamically import a module that depends on other modules. 

## Bug Description

When using dynamic `import()` within a server component, and the imported module relies on other modules, the server component might fail to load correctly, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior. This issue was observed when using dynamic imports within a server component where the imported modules involved React components and other dependencies.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the browser's console or the server logs. 

## Solution

The solution, as shown in `bugSolution.js`, involves refactoring the dynamic import or ensuring all necessary dependencies are properly bundled or handled within the dynamic import process to prevent the dynamic import from causing a failure.
